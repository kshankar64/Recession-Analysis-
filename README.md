# Recession-Analysis-


Project Proposal
Project Name: Recession Analysis Using Python
PROJECT DESCRIPTION (< 150 words)

So, for the task of Recession analysis, we need to have a dataset of the monthly GDP growth of a country. I found an ideal dataset for this task that is based on the monthly GDP growth rate of the United Kingdom. As a recession means the decline in the circulation of money for two consecutive quarters, I will convert our monthly data into quarterly data to analyze the recession and calculate and analyze recession based on quarterly GDP growth. I will also find periods of negative GDP growth (considered recessions), and overall trend in GDP growth over time. 



SOLUTION (Deliverables). Write a bullet point list of what you expect your software will achieve. I do not hold you to this list for your end-product.

GDP growth over time
Analyze recession based on quarterly GDP growth.
Analyze the severity of the recession.
